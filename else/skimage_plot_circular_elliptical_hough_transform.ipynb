        "\n# Circular and Elliptical Hough Transforms\n\nThe Hough transform in its simplest form is a [method to detect\nstraight lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform)_\nbut it can also be used to detect circles or ellipses.\nThe algorithm assumes that the edge is detected and it is robust against\nnoise or missing points.\n\n## Circle detection\n\nIn the following example, the Hough transform is used to detect\ncoin positions and match their edges. We provide a range of\nplausible radii. For each radius, two circles are extracted and\nwe finally keep the five most prominent candidates.\nThe result shows that coin positions are well-detected.\n\n\n### Algorithm overview\n\nGiven a black circle on a white background, we first guess its\nradius (or a range of radii) to construct a new circle.\nThis circle is applied on each black pixel of the original picture\nand the coordinates of this circle are voting in an accumulator.\nFrom this geometrical construction, the original circle center\nposition receives the highest score.\n\nNote that the accumulator size is built to be larger than the\noriginal picture in order to detect centers outside the frame.\nIts size is extended by two times the larger radius.\n"

        "## Ellipse detection\n\nIn this second example, the aim is to detect the edge of a coffee cup.\nBasically, this is a projection of a circle, i.e. an ellipse. The problem\nto solve is much more difficult because five parameters have to be\ndetermined, instead of three for circles.\n\n### Algorithm overview\n\nThe algorithm takes two different points belonging to the ellipse. It\nassumes that it is the main axis. A loop on all the other points determines\nhow much an ellipse passes to them. A good match corresponds to high\naccumulator values.\n\nA full description of the algorithm can be found in reference [1]_.\n\n### References\n..
